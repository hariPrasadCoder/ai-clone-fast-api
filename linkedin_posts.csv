"Dear International Students,
No Summer Internship? No problem.

I’m gonna tell you 7 different ways to build a solid profile this summer and spend this time productively.

Day 5 – Hackathon Hustle

-- Find a fit
 Browse Devpost (https://devpost.com) or MLH (https://mlh.io) for this weekend’s events. Pick one aligned with your interests (AI, fintech, sustainability, etc.).

-- Assemble a micro-team
Hop into the Linkedin or your school community and snag 2–3 teammates. Or maybe use this comment section 👇 Introduce yourself! You might find like minded folks.
Quick tip: advertise a 24-hour MVP goal to attract action-takers.

-- Scope a snack-size project
Aim for a single, eye-catching feature: a data visualization, a chatbot, or an automation script. Keep it under 48 hours.

-- Ship & share
Push your code to GitHub, capture a 15-second demo video, and drop it in the hackathon feed. Tag your teammates and add a one-sentence summary.

-- Leverage the connections
Message fellow hackers on LinkedIn. Congratulate them on their demos, suggest next steps, or propose a follow-up collab.

Day 3 (of 7) – Text startup founders & offer free help

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 1: 
-- Pick a startup you actually like
Scan Product Hunt or your LinkedIn feed. If their landing page makes you nod, they’re a fit.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 2: 
-- Find a quick win
Broken signup flow? Missing dashboard metric? Write 10 lines of code or sketch a redesign in Figma. Screenshot it.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 3: 
-- Send this DM
Hey {Name}! I noticed {pain-point}.
 I mocked up a {solution: attach screenshot/GitHub link}.
 Totally free, use it if it helps. Happy to tackle more fixes if you’re swamped.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 4: 
-- Follow up once, politely
Busy founders appreciate reminders, not spam.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬:
-- Shows initiative, not just interest.
-- Lowers risk for them (free value).
-- Turns “cold outreach” into “warm convo.”

If you need help finding these founders/startups, I know few founders and can try reaching out to them for you. 
Comment down with 3 things you are good at 👇. I can try if I can find a good fit for you.

"Dear International Students,
No Summer Internship? No problem.

I’m gonna tell you 7 different ways to build a solid profile this summer and spend this time productively.

Day 2 (out of 7): Start a Public Learning Log

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭’𝐬 𝐚 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐨𝐠?

Think of it as your dev diary meets highlight reel.

One Linkedin post, every day you build, covering:
-- What I shipped: the tiny win (screenshot or it didn’t happen).
-- What broke: the bug or face-palm moment (humility credits).
-- What’s next: the bite-sized goal you’ll tackle tomorrow.

That’s it. Three bullets. Done before your coffee gets cold.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬
-- Proof of progress ➜ Recruiters and peers track your learning velocity in real time.
-- Built-in accountability ➜ The internet becomes your gym buddy.
-- Networking cheat code ➜ Folks who solve your “What broke” section often become mentors.

𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭?
Open a blank LinkedIn post, drop those three bullets, tag it 
hashtag
#LearningLog, and hit “Post.”

Learning in silence is out; building in public is in.

Do this for the entire summer & see the results.

"Dear International Students,
No Summer Internship? No problem.

I’m gonna tell you 7 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 to build a solid profile this summer and spend this time productively.

𝐃𝐚𝐲 1 (𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 7): 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧-𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞

Recruiters don’t get wow‑ed by “I followed a tutorial.”
They perk up when you say, “I fixed a bug that 300 people hit every day.”

𝐓𝐡𝐞 4‑𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 (𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐲/𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞 𝐢𝐭 𝐭𝐨𝐝𝐚𝐲)

1️⃣ 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐚 𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐨
-- Hit GitHub → search your favorite tech + “good first issue.”
-- Tiny utility? Underdog library? Perfect. Less competition = faster merge.

2️⃣ 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐞 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫‑𝐜𝐮𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦
-- Broken link in docs? Off‑by‑one error?
-- Keep it snack‑size—you want a win, not a saga.

3️⃣ 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐤 → 𝐟𝐢𝐱 → 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐚 𝐏𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭
-- Write a clear commit message: “docs: fix README typo & add quick‑start snippet.”
-- Be polite, answer maintainers quickly, iterate.

4️⃣ 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐬
-- Screenshot the merged PR.
-- Post a short recap: what you fixed, what you learned, why it matters.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬
-- Real‑world impact: 
Your code is now part of someone else’s daily workflow.
-- Instant portfolio piece: 
Link + green GitHub square = proof you can deliver.
-- Built‑in network: 
Maintainers often know hiring managers, lightweight referral factory.

𝐏𝐫𝐨 𝐭𝐢𝐩
Tag the project maintainer in your LinkedIn post. You boost their project; they boost your reach. Everybody wins.

"Let’s talk about writing SQL queries that don’t just get the job done, but run smoothly and efficiently. 

Here are a few quick tips to improve your queries:

1️⃣ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗧𝗘𝘀 & 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿
Skip the complicated nested subqueries. Try using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) instead—they make your code cleaner and easier to follow.

2️⃣ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀
Make sure you’re using the right data types for your columns. For example, if you’re storing numbers, don’t use a text field. This simple step can improve performance and save space.

3️⃣ 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱
Avoid ""SELECT *"" and grab only the columns you actually need. It keeps things faster and easier to maintain.

4️⃣ 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐲
Use your WHERE clause to narrow down data early in the query. The smaller the dataset, the faster the result.

5️⃣ 𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐣𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐬
Joins can get heavy, so always consider the size of the tables. Joining smaller datasets first can help keep things running quickly.

That’s it! Efficient SQL takes practice, but these tips should help you optimize your queries. 

What’s your go-to trick for speeding things up? 👇

"I didn’t have any experience
I didn’t have FAANG referrals.
And I wasn’t a 10x Leetcode warrior.

But I still landed interviews (or offers!) from:
JPMorganChase
Roblox
Snap Inc.
Barclays
Take-Two Interactive

How? 𝐒𝐐𝐋.

In every single one of these interviews,
I was asked SQL questions.

In some, that was the interview.

SQL was my cheat code.
It didn’t care about my GPA, background, or resume template.

If you're preparing for data roles:
✅ Learn SQL deeply
✅ Practice questions from real products (not just made-up toy datasets)
✅ Don’t just memorize syntax — understand the why behind every query

SQL is the most underrated job-changing skill in the data world.

I learned it the hard way.
You don’t have to.

If you're stuck in the SQL round, you're not alone.
It gets easier. Keep grinding.

"8 Tips to go VIRAL on LinkedIn:

8️⃣ Take an old picture from 2021 and attach it to the post even though it's irrelevant.

7️⃣ Copy-paste someone else's success story, but change the names. Pro tip: Add ""True Story"" at the end to make it 100% believable!

6️⃣ Always end the post with ""Agree?""

5️⃣ Write ""Thoughts?"" at the end of every post, even if you haven't actually shared any thoughts yourself

4️⃣ Take your previous viral post and keep reposting it (milk it until you can). Yes, this post is a repost as well.

3️⃣ Always follow the pattern of 3 things, 5 lessons, 8 tips...

"This Resume got me interviews at 
JPMorganChase, Roblox, Snap Inc., Barclays and more!

Here’s how you can land them too:

""Please review my resume"" - the most used phrase on LinkedIn

With the right resume, you can open doors to some amazing opportunities.

Here’s exactly how you should structure a solid resume:

1. Education:
-- Let the hiring manager know the foundation you’ve built.
-- GPA is optional (unless they specifically ask).
-- Use this section to add relevant coursework that boosts keyword visibility.

2. Work Experience:
-- Don’t just list tasks (show how you solved problems).
-- Back it up with results. Use numbers to build credibility.
 – Highlight cross-functional work or team impact where possible.

3. Skills:
-- Highlight the skills you’re confident in applying on Day 1.
-- Focus on a blend of technical and soft skills.
-- This is your keyword goldmine (optimize it smartly).

4. Projects:
-- Great for showcasing hands-on expertise, especially if you're pivoting industries or roles.
-- Projects are your playground (use them to tell your story and interests).
-- Bonus tip: Include links (if public) so they can explore your work.

5. Make it Yours:
-- Templates are fine, but your journey is not a template.
-- Don’t copy-paste others' resumes (personalize your narrative).
-- Let your uniqueness come through subtly but clearly.

Bonus Resume Tips:
-- Stick to 1 page if you have under 8-10 years of experience.
-- Use quantifiable results: “Improved X by Y% through Z.”
-- Avoid jargon, but tailor your language to the job description.
-- Create slightly tweaked versions for different roles (yes, it’s worth the effort).
-- Keep design clean and ATS-friendly (no fancy graphics, no tables).

If you’ve been applying and hearing nothing back, don’t lose hope.

Give these changes a shot for just a couple of weeks, it might be the breakthrough you need.

I know the job search can feel overwhelming and lonely at times, but remember: you’re not alone in this.

You’re doing your best, and that counts for something.

✅ You can also use tools like Teal to build ATS-friendly resumes (not sponsored).

Most people are stuck in an endless cycle of applying, waiting, and hoping.

Here’s how you can do the same:

‣ 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
Engage with hiring managers, post insights, and get on people’s radar. You want them to remember you before you apply.

‣ 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭:
Find 5 people who recently landed the job you want. Study their LinkedIn, portfolios, and interview strategies. Reverse-engineer their success.

‣ 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
Instead of cold applying, get warm introductions. Even one strong referral can be a game-changer.

‣ 𝐈𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 & 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞:
Every rejection is feedback. Adjust your approach, refine your messaging, and keep moving forward.

And the most underrated strategy?

"My LinkedIn profile says I’m working as a Data Scientist in the US and living my dream life.

But, it’s all a LIE!

Because my LinkedIn doesn’t tell you that:

– There was a time when I was jobless and burdened with over $80,000 in student loan debt.

– There was a time when I had to work two part-time jobs just to afford food and daily expenses.

– There was a time when I missed major festivals, weddings, birthdays, and even funerals back home.

– There was a time when I spent mornings moving furniture at a part-time job and came home exhausted, only to stay up late job-hunting.

Life as an international student is often full of hard work, anxiety, and unexpected struggles.

If you ask me: Would I do it all again?

ABSOLUTELY!

"""I like AI… I'm an AI expert…""

Oh really?

""Yes! I know how to use ChatGPT.""
👀

If this is you, it's time to change that.

Because real AI expertise isn’t just about prompting - it’s about understanding how AI works under the hood.

I found an amazing free course by Hugging Face that covers everything you need to actually learn NLP (not just talk about it).

Here’s what’s inside:

1. Transformer Models
- What NLP really is
- How Transformers work (encoders, decoders, sequence-to-sequence)
- The real limitations & biases

2. Using 🤗 Transformers
- Behind the magic of the ""pipeline""
- Models, tokenizers, and decoding sequences

3. Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Model
- Processing & preparing data
- Full training workflows

4. Sharing Models & Tokenizers
- Using & contributing to the Hugging Face Hub
- Building model cards

5. The Datasets Library
- Handling big data
- Creating custom datasets

6. The Tokenizers Library
- Training new tokenizers
- Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece, Unigram

This is the course if you actually want to build AI - not just use it.

👉 Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/enSWf3em

Question for you: Are you ready to move beyond ChatGPT prompts?

"Your Python project is dead, just sitting in your Jupyter notebooks!

That's right! I'll say it again.

You did dashboarding?
You trained cutting-edge ML models?
You got 99% accuracy?

No one cares - unless people can actually use it.

Here are 10 ways you can deploy your Python projects:
🔹 Flask/FastAPI + Gunicorn + Nginx – Host your API on a VPS like AWS, DigitalOcean, or Linode.
🔸 Docker + Kubernetes – Containerize your app and deploy it with orchestration.
🔹 AWS Lambda + API Gateway – Serverless deployment for lightweight functions.
🔸 Heroku – Simple and free-tier-friendly for small projects.
🔹 Google Cloud Run – Deploy containerized apps without managing servers.
🔸 Streamlit – Deploy interactive Python apps quickly.
🔹 PyInstaller – Package your script into an executable for local use.
🔸 Azure Functions – Serverless execution on Microsoft Azure.
🔹 GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Pages – Automate deployments for static sites or APIs.
🔸 Raspberry Pi – Deploy Python scripts for IoT and embedded applications.

Don't stop at your Jupyter notebook project - there's no excuse.

Don't be selfish.

Because we’re all tired of pretending LinkedIn is a TED Talk stage and we’re the over-rehearsed speakers.

You tweak your resume 47 times.
You write cover letters that sound like Shakespeare (but no one reads).
You overthink every LinkedIn post because What if HR sees this?

The job you land will probably come from one simple connection or one bold move - not the 47th edit.

"Ever wondered why AI-generated content sounds like it was written by... well, a robot?

I had the pleasure of tackling this exact challenge yesterday. I was invited as a speaker at the AICamp event, hosted at Microsoft NYC and sponsored by Google.

The energy in the room was electric! We dove deep into the world of AI content creation and explored practical ways to make AI writing sound more human. The engagement and questions from the audience were incredible - clearly this is a pain point many of us share.

What struck me most? 
The diverse perspectives and creative solutions that emerged during our discussions. From founders to developers, everyone had unique insights to share.

From my job search phase till now I have been followed many influencers on LinkedIn, who has struggled, hustled and made their space in US corporate markets and following them I also did the same but I was lucky to have their guidance and contents they shared so that I do not make any mistakes. For a long time, I wanted to connect with a 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥, and this time, I finally got the opportunity and had a great conversation with Hari Prasad Renganathan on Saturday, where he took the time to help me understand the data science industry and how to prepare for corporate roles.

"Dear Employers, 
Please DON'T HIRE International Students!
🇺🇸🇬🇧🇨🇦

- They are not ambitious.
All they did was leave everything behind, move across the world, and start over for a better future.

- They aren’t good communicators.
They just happen to speak 2–3 languages fluently.

- They can’t multi-task.
Except for juggling coursework, exams, job hunting, networking, part-time jobs, and staying connected with family across time zones.

- They aren’t adaptable.
They only adjust to a new country, culture, education system, and work environment—nothing major.

- They lack resilience.
Handling visa stress, job rejections, and endless uncertainty? That’s nothing.

"Plot twist: Remember my post about NOT using AI for LinkedIn content?

insert dramatic pause

You know, the one where I boldly claimed:
""Just used AI to write my LinkedIn post... said no successful content creator ever""

Well... 🥁

That post was written by AI.

Oh, the irony! There I was, preaching about authenticity while an AI crafted the perfect sermon about not using AI. It's like wearing a ""I hate fast food"" t-shirt while eating a Big Mac.

The best part? You all loved it. The comments section was filled with ""So true!"" and ""Couldn't agree more!""

So what's the real lesson here?

Maybe it's not about whether you use AI or not. Maybe it's about knowing how to use it right. Like having a ghostwriter who knows your voice so well, they can write your autobiography.

And yes, this post is human-written.
(Or is it? 🤔)

What do you think - does it matter who (or what) writes the content as long as it resonates with the audience?

"""Just used AI to write my LinkedIn post!""

...said no successful content creator ever.

Here's why AI-written posts fail:
- They lack your authentic voice
- They miss personal experiences & stories
- They sound robotic (ironically!)
- Everyone else is using them (your feed probably has 10 AI posts right now)

The result? Your audience can smell the AI from miles away.

I learned this the hard way. After experimenting with AI tools, my engagement dropped. Why? Because my followers couldn't connect with the perfect but soulless content.

Real engagement comes from real stories, real failures, and real wins.

"Breaking AI News: A $50 Model Just Beat OpenAI's o1!

Think you need millions to build cutting-edge AI? Think again! 

Stanford and UW researchers just flipped the script with their new model 's1'.

Here's what's mind-blowing:
- Built with just $50 in cloud credits
- Trained in 26 minutes (yes, minutes!)
- Outperformed OpenAI's o1 by 27% on math problems
- Used only 1,000 carefully selected questions

The secret sauce? 
A brilliant technique called ""budget forcing"" - proving that constraints breed innovation. Instead of throwing money at the problem, they got creative with resources.

This isn't just about building a better model. It's about democratizing AI research. No more ""only big tech can innovate"" narrative. The future of AI might not be in massive data centers, but in clever solutions from resourceful teams.

What's even better? It's open-source! Anyone can build upon this breakthrough.

"5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Coming to the US:

1. 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐝𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐞 𝐣𝐨𝐛𝐬.
 It’s a tough truth I faced even as an Ivy League grad. Your degree might open the door, but it’s your extra effort, persistence, and networking that land you the job.

2. 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬.
 Chasing the perfect GPA feels rewarding, but employers care more about real-world skills, internships, and the relationships you build. Your network will take you farther than your transcript.

3. 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮.
 The costs are overwhelming—a single doctor’s visit can set you back hundreds of dollars. In those early days, spending in dollars can feel like a constant drain, but don’t neglect your health. It’s priceless.

4. 𝐂𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮.
 Adjusting isn’t always as easy as watching Hollywood movies. From accents to social norms, you’ll meet people from all over the world, just like yourself. Embrace the diversity—it’ll shape you in ways you never imagined.

5. 𝐋𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮.
 There will be nights when you miss home so much it hurts, or days when nothing seems to go as planned. But remember, staying connected with family and friends will be your lifeline. You’re never truly alone.

So why do we still choose this path? 

Because it’s worth it. Your struggles will transform into growth, your sacrifices into successes. And one day, when you look at your first paycheck or feel the sense of belonging, you’ll know—you made it. One day, you’ll feel like YOU ARE HOME!

The same goes for you. If you changed something on your resume and got rejected? Share it with others who haven’t made that mistake yet. You’re influencing them too.

There's more drama...

OpenAI has accused DeepSeek of using its models without permission to develop the powerful R1 system. 

Microsoft (OpenAI's biggest investor) is now investigating whether DeepSeek secretly accessed OpenAI's data. They're looking into suspicious accounts that might have been extracting information from OpenAI's systems.

The U.S. government is taking action, with the White House calling it a security threat and the Navy banning DeepSeek’s tech.

Well, we're witnessing exactly that right now.

A Chinese startup called DeepSeek AI just achieved something remarkable - they've created an AI that matches ChatGPT's capabilities at a fraction of the cost. Their app even knocked ChatGPT off the top spot in Apple's App Store!

But here's where it gets really interesting...

While tech giants spend billions on infrastructure, DeepSeek claims they built their AI for just $6 million. 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐅𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐢 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐓𝐨𝐲𝐨𝐭𝐚!

- The Nasdaq dropped 3.1%
- The entire tech sector is questioning its approach

Think about it: What if building powerful AI doesn't require billions in investment anymore?

"Ever caught yourself in that classic data dilemma? 

As a data professional, I've often found myself staring at my screen, wondering whether to trust the cold, hard numbers or that gut feeling telling me something's off.

Here's the truth: It's not about choosing one over the other. The real magic happens when you blend both.

Think about it:
– Data gives you the facts
– Instinct brings context
– Experience helps you interpret
– Intuition spots the outliers

I learned this the hard way when I ignored a strange pattern in my model because ""the numbers looked right."" Turns out, my instincts were trying to tell me something the data couldn't capture.

The next time you're caught between data and instinct, remember: The best decisions come from letting them work together, not against each other.

– Spent hours cleaning data only to find out it’s just a formatting issue
– Had a colleague ask if Python is like Excel
– Pretended to understand a complex model but had to Google it later
– Been asked to explain ""what data science is"" for the 100th time at family gatherings
– Watched a model ""train"" for hours, only to realize you forgot to set the correct parameters

"“Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” 

The toughest question ever.

Here’s my last 5 years in a nutshell: 

↳ Top 10% in undergrad Mechanical Engineering, thought that was my path.
↳ Took a detour into Excel & Data Analytics courses.
↳ Gave up on Data—too complex, too math-heavy.
↳ Built a website for bloggers, then quit.
↳ Tried everything else—branding, marketing, trading, video editing.
↳ Came back to data, this time through programming.
↳ Got hooked on web scraping & automation.
↳ Discovered Machine Learning & wanted more.
↳ Joined a top-tier Data Science program.
↳ Got into finance (thanks, New York).
↳ Landed a Data Science internship at a gaming company.
↳ Started sharing my journey on LinkedIn & YouTube.

If this seems like wasted time, I thought so too—until I realized it wasn’t.

Every skill I learned—branding, marketing, video editing, automation—I use them today.

Steve Jobs said, “You can only connect the dots looking backwards.” And it makes sense.

So, if you’re unsure where you’re headed, that’s fine. Enjoy the process. The dots WILL connect. 💛","https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7286211981060046848","3mo"
"What's the difference between a Good, Bad & Great Project?

A BAD project:
↳ Showcases your technical skills
↳ Uses upcoming technology
↳ Looks cool on paper

A GOOD project:
↳ Showcases both your soft and technical skills
↳ Provides a good learning experience

A GREAT project:
↳ Solves a real problem
↳ Makes an impact on the world

The secret? Stop building projects. Start building products.

Think about it - which would impress a hiring manager more:
Another Titanic classification project
OR
A real product that people actually use?

"2021: The Year of Post-Covid Market
2023: The Year of Layoffs
2024: The Year AI was feared to replace jobs
2025: The Year of... Who knows what?

Do you see a pattern here?

Everything sounds negative, right? Should we just wait for ""our time""?

NOPE!

Yes, the market is tough right now. But that doesn’t mean there are no job openings out there.

The solution isn’t to ignore the situation and wait for things to change. 

Instead:

– Acknowledge and accept that the market is challenging.

– Plan how to outsmart it and make yourself stand out.

Let’s make 2025 the year where we stop blaming the market and take control of our own careers.

Let’s rise together!

P.S.: Sorry for getting a bit emotional here, I’ve been getting so many DMs from people losing hope because they think the market is bad. Don’t give up—you’ve got this!","https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7284730616175054848","3mo"
"That moment when you realize AI can do your job... it's both exciting and terrifying, isn't it? 

But here's the truth - AI isn't here to replace us, it's here to elevate us.

Think about it:

– While AI handles repetitive tasks, we can focus on strategy

– When AI crunches data, we bring human creativity

– As AI generates content, we add emotional intelligence

The future belongs to those who learn to dance with AI, not those who run from it. 

The question isn't whether AI can do your job - it's how you'll evolve to do things AI can't.","https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7284377486128214017","3mo"
"What if people on LinkedIn were honest?!

I'm beyond excited (actually desperate for likes) to share my Google journey.

Feeling blessed (also showing off to make you jealous) to announce that after 2 weeks at Google, I'm already a Senior Staff Engineer (technically still in onboarding).

Here's what I learned in my journey to the top (aka sitting in orientation)

1. Always be humble (while posting selfies in front of the Google logo everyday)
2. Hustle culture is everything (I spend 6 hours daily crafting LinkedIn posts instead of coding)
3. Leadership is about inspiring others (I haven't met my team yet, but I'm already giving career advice)
4. Never stop learning (I've mastered copying and pasting from Stack Overflow)
5. Build your personal brand (by reposting motivational quotes with random stock photos)

Special shoutout to my team (whom I haven't met) and my mentor (who doesn't know they're my mentor).

The key to success is authenticity (and writing every sentence on a new line for better engagement).

Agree?

"My LinkedIn profile says I’m working as a Data Scientist in the US and living my dream life.

But, it’s all a LIE!

Because my LinkedIn doesn’t tell you that:

– There was a time when I was jobless and burdened with over $80,000 in student loan debt.

– There was a time when I had to work two part-time jobs just to afford food and daily expenses.

– There was a time when I missed major festivals, weddings, birthdays, and even funerals back home.

– There was a time when I spent mornings moving furniture at a part-time job and came home exhausted, only to stay up late job-hunting.

Life as an international student is often full of hard work, anxiety, and unexpected struggles.

If you ask me: Would I do it all again?

ABSOLUTELY!

It has taught me lessons I’ll never forget.
It has given me exposure I wouldn’t have had otherwise.

Dedicating this to all international students—Cheers to your resilience and determination! 🥂
